# **App Name**: DataVue

## Core Features:

- Data Ingestion: Configure and ingest data from various sources: serial, USB, CSV, XLS, TCP, UDP, and user-defined APIs.
- Protocol Support: Handle various industrial protocols: OSI PI, OPC, MODBUS, MQTT, NMEA, HART, 4-20mA, 0-5v with user-defined configurations.
- Map Visualization: Display real-time data on a map, either automatically via location data from a source, or via manually placed icons.
- Dynamic Visuals: Render dynamically updating charts and gauges based on user-selected data streams.
- Configurable Storage: Allow users to store data, based on guidance from the LLM tool, with support for major database brands, cloud services (Azure, Google, AWS).
- User Management: Provide granular user management and permissions control for data access and configuration.
- Protocol Translation Tool: Use AI to determine when and if to attempt to translate a signal received from an obscure or undocumented protocol to a common format, for display and analysis.  If so, log the conversion.
